# Folder: `types`

Types, here, refers to types and interfaces re-used across the application.

## Folder structure

The folder structure is as follows:

- 📁 `types` (folder)
  - 📄 `{type}.ts` (file)

### Notes

- `{type}` is the name of the type or interface, in kebab-case
- Each `{type}.ts` file contains only one type or interface, which is exported
