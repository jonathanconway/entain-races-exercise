MINH JACK (6) was strongly fancied last time and hit the ground running with a fast early split, paving the way for a 4 length win at Gawler over 400m in 22.87. Winner at his latest appearance in one of the quickest times on the card. Has definite claims. MY RUSTY HALO (8) has been beaten for early speed lately, last time finishing fifth (23.25) in a Other at Gawler. Has a good record at this journey. Can do much better this time. NATURALISM (1) is always a threat when he races at this journey.",
