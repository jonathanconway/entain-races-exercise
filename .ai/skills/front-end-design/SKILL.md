This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade, brand-aware frontend interfaces. Implement real working code with attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to an effective aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Use a correct, brand-aware tone: minimal, polished. Visit [Neds](http://neds.com.au) and other similar websites and use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility AA+).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNREGRETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will appreciate most?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. The key is intentionality and practicality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, Vue, Tailwind) that is:

- Production-grade and functional
- Visually appealing and distinctive
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:

- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are consistent with the brand and appropriate for the content being depicted.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that delight.
- **Spatial Composition**: Elegance and refinement. Generous negative space OR controlled density.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision, which is a minimalist, refined design. Restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.
